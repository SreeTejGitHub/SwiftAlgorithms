# SwiftAlgorithms

Apple's open source Swift Algorithms package comes with stacks of types and functions that help us write faster, simpler, safer Swift code. Here I'm going to walk you through a handful of my favorite parts of the package so you can get started fast.

Chaining sequences
Chunking sequences
Random sampling
Striding over a sequence
Finding unique elements
Stripping out optionality
Improving nested loops
Sliding windows into sequences
Minimum and maximum
