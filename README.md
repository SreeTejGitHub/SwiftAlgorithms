# SwiftAlgorithms

Apple's open source Swift Algorithms package comes with stacks of types and functions that help us write faster, simpler, safer Swift code. Here I'm going to walk you through a handful of my favorite parts of the package so you can get started fast.

* Chaining sequences
* Chunking sequences
* Random sampling
* Striding over a sequence
* Finding unique elements
* Stripping out optionality
* Improving nested loops
* Sliding windows into sequences
* Minimum and maximum
